This was a month-long event wherein players were introduced to the world of Snottingham through a four-part Dungeons and Dragons based mini-campaign.
Sessions were run by DevSoc Committee members [Jarad](https://github.com/JRad99) and [Hannah](https://github.com/Hannah-Ashna) from the 10th of June till the 1st of July with a total of four (3 - 4 hour sessions each week).

### Welcome to Snottingham:

Snottingham is the home of legendary outlaw Robin Hood, dynamic culture, rich history and sporting glory. Snottingham is one of Albion's top destinations where a warm welcome always awaits. 

The city was built atop the crowns of majestic hills and is truly a classic phenomenon. Its wonder is matched by the backdrop of everclear skies. Business is always booming in Snottingham, and it has attracted a lot of attention. Countless cultures have left their mark not just on trade and relations, but also upon the city's identity. It's this multicultural identity that has truly shaped Snottingham into the cultural hub that it is today.
